# Lopply

This project is a web platform for discovering and tracking running races in Sweden and around the world. Users can filter events, save favorites to a personal bucket list, get matched with races based on their running preferences and add new races. Admin can approve submitted races, manage access and delete events. The goal is to create an interactive, user-friendly tool that connects runners with upcoming events and makes race discovery easier.
